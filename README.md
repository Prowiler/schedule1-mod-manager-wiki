## ðŸŒŸ Core Features
The Mod Manager & Phone App provides:
- **Main Menu Management**:
    - **Mods Tab**: Enable/disable mods (.dll <-> .dll.disabled). *Requires game restart.*
    - **Config Tab**: View and configure settings for **all** registered mods, or filter by a specific mod, directly from the main menu. Includes Save/Reset functionality.
- **In-Game Phone App**: A dedicated phone app interface ("Settings") for users to configure compatible mod settings interactively *during* gameplay.
- **Expanded Settings Support**: Includes UI controls for common types like Booleans, Numbers, Strings, KeyCodes, Enums (Dropdowns), and Colors (Sliders/Input/Preview).
- **Separate Save Events**: Distinct events are fired when saving from the Phone App vs. the Main Menu Config panel, allowing mods to react accordingly.
- **Dynamic Update Support**: An event system allows mods to apply setting changes live without requiring a game restart (if implemented by the mod).
